General information
-------------------

Users should be familiar with the concepts introduced in the book and with the user's manual to run the GSM codes.

The GSM codes are in the "GSM_code" directory.

Most files of the GSM codes are commented, in particular the routines in "numlib" and "GSM_dir". 
However, the GSM-CC reaction code is not commented for the moment.

The provided directory "workspace_for_GSM" contains interaction files for special options.

The parameters of input files are described in the user's manual (GSM_manual.pdf).

README files are present in all directories Exercises/Chapter_[number]/Exercise_[number], associated to the exercises provided in the book. 
They describe how to run the code dedicated to each exercise. 
Input and output files are provided.

If users want to use the files in "test_files" directories to test codes, as mentioned in the user's manual, they must copy the content of "workspace_for_GSM" to their own workspace.

The use of many-body projectiles in GSM-CC is in development. 
Codes might run, but results might not be correct.
Hence, no information is provided for the moment about the use of many-body projectiles in the user's manual.
